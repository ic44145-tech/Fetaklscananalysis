# The `helper.py` defines some repeating and required functionalities that are called and used by the application.
# For example, it consists of functions like PIL Image to texture conversion and the converse of it.
# `ellipse_fitting.py` defines the core functional algorithm for brain biometry parameter: head circumference measurement.

# The redundant function `custom_widgets.py` was created initially to fetch in the transducer specification and analyzing it to find the pixel spacing estimate.
# It fetches the information as given in the `.xlsx` file and compute the physical spacing.
